# Puzzle-Maze
We wanted to explore the input/output system in a fun way way so we decided to make a nice game, this was one of our first games and it really thought us a lot about programming and project making and managing. Let's see if you can find the eastereggs in this game :). The source code is in our Github, feel free to download it and mess with it a little bit.
if you dont want to mess with the code go to the Debug folder and open the CMD file and play!
